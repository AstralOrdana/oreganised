description='''
Oreganized is a mod focusing on adding new ores and metals to Minecraft. Currently it adds, Lead and Silver as base metals and a new alloy known as Electrum.
This mod is designed to be a Vanilla plus mod while also adding unique uses and abilities to its content rather than just meaningless toolsets for a more engaging experience that tries to match the quality of Mojang's own implementations of new content.
